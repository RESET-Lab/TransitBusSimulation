# Transit Bus Simulation

 ## Overview

The goal of this repository is to create a side-by-side comparison of transit buses with combustion engines with those that are electric to advise policy in Mexico City.

Obtaining all the data was completed without any on-vehicle sensors. The process started by obtaining the shapefile route of each transit bus in Mexico City. These were then projected into a different coordinate refrence system to make them easier to work with [`CRS Projection`]. Then, elevation for points across the route were queried to calculate the gradient [`Gradient Querying`]. Next, traffic and speed data were utilized to create a speed profile of the area during different seasons and times of the day [`Speed Querying`]. This profile and the gradient data were then spatially joined and used to create a complete drive cycle with a one second resolution [`Cycle Generation`]. Finally, using these drive cycles along with bus specifications, a simulation software named FASTSim was employed to predict the difference in energy consumption profiles of electric and combustion engine along these routes [`Simulation`].

 ## Data Sources

 The data used in this project comes from the following sources:
 * Bus Route Shapefiles [add source]
 * Waze Speed Data [https://wazeopedia.waze.com/wiki/USA/Traffic_data]

 The software used in the project can be found here:
 * Google Maps Elevation API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation]

## Development Setup

### macOS

1. Clone this repository and `cd` inside.
1. Ensure python 3.7.9 is available on the systeem via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
    ```sh
    brew install pyenv
    pyenv local 3.7.9
    ```
1. Create a python virtual environment and jupyter kernel.
    ```sh
    # Create the virtual environment, in which the package versions specified in the Pipfile will be installed
    pipenv install --python 3.7.9

    # Activate the virtual environment
    pipenv shell

    # Create a jupyter kernel tied to the active python virtual environment
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=tbs-kernel
    ```
1. Start the jupyter lab: `jupyter lab`
    - The first time you do this, you'll need to specify which kernel to use via the jupyter lab browser UI. TODO include screenshot.

### Windows
